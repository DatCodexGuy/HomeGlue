# Assets and Inventory

HomeGlue tracks inventory in a few different ways:

- **Assets**: physical or logical things (servers, laptops, firewalls, printers, etc.)
- **Config Items**: configuration/infrastructure items (hosts, services, VMs/containers, etc.)
- **Flexible Assets**: user-defined types for structured data that doesn’t fit the built-in models

## Common Features

- Tags
- Attachments
- Notes
- Relationships (link anything to anything)
- Custom fields (org-admin defines; members fill values)
- Archive/restore (soft-delete)

## CSV Import/Export

Most list pages have Export CSV and Import CSV actions for bulk changes.
