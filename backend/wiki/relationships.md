# Relationships

Relationships link any two org-scoped objects (any-to-any).

## Relationship Types

Relationship Types are org-scoped and define the label shown in each direction.

Examples:

- “Runs On” / “Hosts”
- “Depends On” / “Depended On By”

Org admins manage relationship types.

## Object Linking

Most object detail pages show a Relationships panel where you can add links to other objects.
