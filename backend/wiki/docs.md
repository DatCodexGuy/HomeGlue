# Documents and Templates

## Documents

Documents are org-scoped pages used for SOPs, internal notes, and knowledge base content.

Features:

- Templates (optional)
- Document folders (nested)
- Tags
- Attachments
- Notes
- Relationships
- Version history + restore
- Visibility / ACL (org/admins/private/shared)
- Flag/Unflag for “important” docs

## Templates

Templates are reusable document bodies. You can create docs from templates, and import/export templates via CSV.

## Import/Export

Docs CSV import supports an optional `folder` column. Folder values can be a path like `Runbooks/Onboarding` and HomeGlue will create folders as needed.
